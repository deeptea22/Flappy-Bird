# Flappy-Bird
### Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which we controls a bird, which moves persistently to the right. We are tasked with navigating the bird through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. The bird automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the up arrow key. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. 

## Controls
### Up arrow key - flying/ ascending the bird
